Notes:

- Consider using radio buttons for artist answers too. Try renaming the name & class in the input type. Originally used checkboxes for the artist answers & radios for the guitar answers.

- Can figure out how to end game. Once the last questions is answered, the app needs to tell the user it's game over and provide an option to start over.

- Swap button colors






$("#next_question").on("click", "#nextButton", function () {
	if (currentQuestion < questions.length) {
	$("#next_question").css("display","none");
	$("#info").css("display","none");
	currentQuestion++;
	populateQuestionaire(currentQuestion);
// advance to the next question values in the array
	updateResultsCounter();
	$("#submit_answer").css("display","inline"); 
	} else {
		$("#next_question").css("display","none");
		$("#info").css("display","none");
		alert("Congratulations on finishing the quiz!");
	}

});
